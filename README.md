## 👋 Hi, my name is Francis.

I'm a Senior Partner Engineer at GitHub (the very site you're on!) as Employee #625. Currently, I lead our Global Expansion team working on internationalization and localization. Before that, I served as a technical support engineer specializing in GitHub's Platform (API, apps, webhooks) and CI/CD capabilities (Actions, Registry), with a brief stint as a program manager for the GitHub Support Community.

My most valued work practices are building high-trust relationships, cultivating high psyschological safety, exercising curiosity, and creating space to learn and solve problems together. I love pair programming! 🍐
