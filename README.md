👋 Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub on the New User Experience team, where I work on initiatives that streamline signups, simplify onboarding, and surface the highest-signal information on the dashboard—helping millions of developers get the most out of GitHub and GitHub Copilot. I build with React, TypeScript, and Rails, and I'm experienced in A/B testing, feature flagging, and conversion optimization. I also serve as an Incident Commander, helping keep GitHub reliable during critical incidents.

Previous to my current role, I spent time in partner engineering and program management, where I built localization infrastructure for GitHub Docs and designed nurture campaigns connecting marketing systems to customer workflows.

Earlier in my career, I joined GitHub in 2015 as a Support Engineer, building expertise in REST/GraphQL APIs, OAuth, and the GitHub Apps platform—knowledge that still informs how I think about developer experience today.

I believe in learning in public, pair programming, and creating brave spaces where teams can thrive. I'm committed to building inclusive products and environments where great work happens.
