## 👋 Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub working on [GitHub Education](https://education.github.com/).

Previously, I worked on GitHub Discussions along with prototyping an internationalized and localized version of GitHub.com to expand the platform's language offerings beyond English. As a developer myself, I know how important it is to have access to resources in your native language, and I'm passionate about making sure engineers all over the world can benefit from our platform. 🗺️

I joined GitHub in 2015 as a Support Engineer, where I advised customers to make the most of their GitHub workflow, optimizing usage of the GitHub API, integrations, and devops features. Since then, I've worked brief stints in program management and partner engineering roles, where I focused on improving content localization for GitHub Docs and fostering a thriving GitHub Community. 🫂

Creating a positive and inclusive work environment is essential to doing great work. I'm a big believer in learning in public, pairing programming, and keeping it classy. I actively work to create "brave spaces" where my team and I can thrive and grow together. ✨
