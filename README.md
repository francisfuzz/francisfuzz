## 👋

My name is Francis. I'm a Senior Partner Engineer at GitHub where I have the privilege of enabling GitHub's Technology Partners to create compelling experiences for our shared customers. I've been with GitHub since 2015 starting as a Support Engineer, followed by a brief stint as a program manager. My professional background is an eclectic mix of software engineering, support, and teaching. Cultivating high psyschological safety, exercising curiosity, and creating space to learn and solve problems together are my most valued work practices.

### Words I live by

> “He drew a circle that shut me out-

> Heretic, rebel, a thing to flout.

> But love and I had the wit to win:
> 
> We drew a circle and took him In!”
