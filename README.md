## 👋 Hi, my name is Francis.

I'm a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub (the very site you're on!). Currently, I am the lead engineer for our Global Expansion team working on internationalization and localization. I joined GitHub in 2015 as its 625th employee as a Technical Support Engineer.

My most valued work practices are building high-trust relationships, cultivating high psyschological safety, exercising curiosity, and creating space to learn and solve problems together (I love pair programming! 🍐 ).

### Words I live by
