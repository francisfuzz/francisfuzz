## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer on GitHub's Communities team working on [Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions), the home for developer communities. Previously, I Worked on internationalization and localization.

I joined GitHub in December 2015 as Employee #625 starting as a technical support engineer focused on GitHub's Platform (API, apps, webhooks) and CI/CD capabilities (Actions, Registry). From there, I worked as a program manager for the GitHub Support Community and as a partner engineer for GitHub's Technology Partnerships & Engineering team.

I value building high-trust relationships, cultivating high psyschological safety, exercising curiosity, and creating space to learn and solve problems together with my teammates.
