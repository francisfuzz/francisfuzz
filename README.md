## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm a Senior Software Engineer on GitHub's Communities team working on [Discussions](https://github.com/features/discussions), the home for developer communities.

I joined GitHub in December 2015 as Employee #625 starting as a technical support engineer focused on GitHub's Platform (API, apps, webhooks) and CI/CD capabilities (Actions, Registry). From there, I worked as a program manager for the GitHub Support Community, a partner engineer for GitHub's Technology Partnerships & Engineering team, and a software engineer focused on internationalization and localization projects.

I value building high-trust relationships, cultivating high psyschological safety, exercising curiosity, and creating space to learn and solve problems together with my teammates.
