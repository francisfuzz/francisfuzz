## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Francis!

I'm currently a Senior Software Engineer at GitHub working on the New User Experience team. âœ¨

Previously, I worked on GitHub Education, GitHub Discussions, and internationalizing GitHub's products. I joined GitHub in 2015 as a Support Engineer, where I advised customers to make the most of their GitHub workflow, optimizing usage of the GitHub API, integrations, and devops features. Since then, I've worked brief stints in program management and partner engineering roles, where I focused on improving content localization for GitHub Docs and fostering a thriving GitHub Community. ðŸ«‚

Creating a positive and inclusive work environment is essential to doing great work. I'm a big believer in learning in public, pairing programming, and keeping it classy. I actively work to create "brave spaces" where my team and I can thrive and grow together. âœ¨
